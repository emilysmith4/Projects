### 1. **Rubrik Pipeline Order Prediction** <br />
  This code is from an internship I did with a company called Rubrik over this past summer and I cleared some outputs to hide sensitive information for the company. <br />
##### _Overview:_ <br />
  Employees, especially the engineers, within the company can place orders for items in order to build and test code. These orders are then sent through an extensive pipeline to build the order to the specified requirements. This process can take time, especially when orders are placed at the same time. To reduce time spent waiting for orders, ideally items can be prepared before the order was even placed. Thus, the main goal of the project was to produce a forecasting algorithm that can predict how many items will be ordered in a certain timeframe, so they can be prepared for when someone orders it. <br />
